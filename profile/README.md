<h1 align="center">CybriaTech</h1>

We are a group of middle schoolers dedicated to making websites for the sole purpose of ending internet censorship and allowing people to access blocked content.

## Why?

Blocking content like game websites or even YouTube makes it no fun, so the motivation is lower if we don't have something to be entertained with. Boredness is our enemy.

## Our Goal

We hope to grow and counter companies and organizations that enforce the restrictions we oppose, including <a href="https://www.contentkeeper.com/">ContentKeeper</a>, <a href="https://www.securly.com/">Securly</a>, <a href="https://www.dyknow.com/">Dyknow</a>, and school district firewalls. Our aim is to eliminate all censorship that restricts free access to the web.

## Who Are We?

For security reasons, it's crucial to not release any information associated with CybriaTech. We aim to protect everyone involved from potential trouble, whether they are part of our group or affiliated with web-filtering companies opposing us.
