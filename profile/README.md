<h1 align="center">CybriaTech</h1>
<h2 align="center">The one and only organization to include Everything.</h2>


We are a small team of programmers dedicated to fighting against <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/childrens-internet-protection-act">CIPA</a> for the euthanization of internet censorship for students and employees with web filters.

## Why?

Laws like <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/childrens-internet-protection-act">CIPA</a> are too harsh for us, we believe that our rights and freedom as children should also be applied to the internet too, even if it takes precious resources, time money and people.

## Our Goal

We hope to grow and crush such tyrannical laws like CIPA and web filtering companies including <a href="https://www.imperosoftware.com/us/">Impero Software</a> and unnecessary applications . Our aim is to eliminate all censorship that restricts free access to the web.

## Who Are We?

For security reasons, it's crucial to not release any personal information associated with CybriaTech. We aim to protect everyone involved from potential trouble, whether they are part of our group or affiliated with web-filtering companies opposing us and our school district finding out who we are.
